# ESCAPE!
A dungeon crawler based game.

A little project of mine to learn more complex game development.

The idea is to create a 2d top-down game based on dungeons(levels). 
Player will try to find an escape route from dungeons, meeting enemies on the way.
There will be a shop for items. Mobs will also drop loot.
I MIGHT include random level generation ---> pretty complex stuff.
The game will contain a world/level editor for creating / editing levels.
Game will contain save / load system.
The game will use pixel art.

Feel free to comment ;)
